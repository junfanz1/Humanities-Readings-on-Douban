### 1.1   王沪宁《比较政治分析》随感与摘录

本文已永久丢失。随感保存如下，摘录是截图方式（文字更为敏感），整篇书评被豆瓣删除无法找回。

随感（2021年3月前后）： 本书当之无愧是满分5☆好评，就其吸引力和玄妙程度来说可以打6☆或7☆。国师在这本书里，对政治分析有一个高屋建瓴的把握。所谓“比较”就是纵论古今，这也是王沪宁本人政治观淋漓尽致的充分展现，可见其胸中丘壑。政治思想方面，本本书透露着浓厚的未来主义气息，如对未来无政治时代的憧憬，和围绕人类未来理性活动的“生命冲动”和“超理性体验”的探讨，尤其是第七章，读来非常过瘾。不同于《当代西方政治学分析》那种广而笼统的观感，本书是完全写中国视角下的国家理论，格局之广阔、视野之宏大，深究其字里行间，有如拨云见日。

对于目前为止已经读过的王沪宁的五本书，如果做个引人入胜程度的排行榜，我认为是《比较政治分析》>《美国反对美国》>《狮城舌战》>《政治的人生》>《当代西方政治学分析》。

本书论述的精彩之处：40页，人类历史的四种国家形式演变：军事化国家、宗教化国家，政制化国家，经济化国家。由经济化国家带来的三大观念：多元主义、技治主义、社团主义。197-208页，意识形态的终结、非政治化，以及再意识形态化，分析地透彻。人类虽然跨入了现代化的时代，但并没有达到一个科学可以代替一切的时代。

读罢随想。如最后一章提到的，当代世界的一大奇观是知识爆炸。现代人类的思想呈现一种放任扩张式的飞跃发展，发展出浩瀚如繁星、琳琅满目的理论。面对这一色彩奇异的思想画像，我们需要去“比较”、“分析”，探索思维的结构。摘下其中一个星星都是无底的深渊，人可以在无穷多独立自洽的体系中栖居钻研，树立为信念和抱负。随着人的全面发展，看似能有效缓解分歧的鸿沟，尽管可以兼容不同意识的相互交织，但仍然不能达到彼此充分理解的境界——因为观念的世界是要穷其一生要去发扬和深究的，但人只能活一个人生，不能活多个不同人的人生，而融会贯通博古通今的人是极稀少的。有的人看问题眼光深邃，洞若观火，有的人目光狭隘，不见森林。我们经常会推翻旧有认知，并在这种洗礼中对最适合人类生活的形式有了更明确、更执着的追求，于是建构起追求理想和外来的、超前于现实的价值和自身认知。而这根本上导致人越是要全面发展，越是发觉深陷泥淖；在黑暗中想要“祛魅”点亮了灯，却发现更为广博无际的黑暗；越是在频繁交流互动中碰撞思想的火花，却越发察觉到孤独的本质。唯一的办法，是在分歧中寻共识，在共识中寻找一个大同的愿景，在茫茫大海里寻找同样形状的鹅卵石，反过来还要在无尽的矛盾中安放有限的自己。读书的意义，在于用捷径跨越思想的界限，这是否是对于前面悲观论调的一种实现灵魂救赎的形式呢？二十一世纪，谁拥有知识，谁就找到了未来，谁掌握浩如烟海的学问，谁能引领历史的新潮流。
